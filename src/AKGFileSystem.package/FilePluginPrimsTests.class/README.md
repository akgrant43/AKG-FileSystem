FilePluginPrimsTests provides some additional tests that aren't appropriate to include in the standard image, generally because of one or more of the following:

- The test is dependent on packages that aren't part of the standard image
- The test results need to be manually checked
- The test includes messages that are generally considered bad practice (but convenient within the scope of the test)
